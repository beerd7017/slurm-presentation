## Slurm?

**S**ensing the environment

**L**earning the signs of trouble

**U**nderstanding how to cope with the enviorment

**R**efactoring the environment

**M**oving On

----

## Sensing the environment

----

### Body language

Are people heads down or engaged in the conversation?

Is there eye rolling whenever a certain person speaks?

Is there uneasiness when someone walks into the room?

Is someone showing a nervous tick?

----

## Tone of speech

Sarcasm. Should we use it?

Does someones speech engage the people in the room?

Is the fire behind someone's speech out of excitement, anger, nervousness?

----

## Tone of text?

Don't bother me.

Don't bother me.

----

## Us vs Them

Are your users "dumb". 

Have you ever classified bugs as I-O-D-1-T errors?

----

## Buzz or Dazed

Gun-ho vs ho-hum?

----

## Do you have that one hero that always saves the day?

Do they keep that knowledge close or do they try to shared and mentor?

Do your seniors mentor your juniors?

Do you juniors mentor your seniors?

----

## Alignment, Debates, and Arguments

How does your exec team speak about your company and your product?

Is your dev shop considered the forefront of what you are building?

In meetings with executives do they seem aligned? Do they speak in the same terms?

Do they seem surprised or blind sighted by each other?

----

## What's really going on?

Deadline's a-comin'

Deployments when south

Conversation domination

----

![profile-pic](images/about/slurm3.jpg)

----

## No, what's really going on?

Life happens.

Health, death, newborns, marriage, divorce, bought a house

----

## It's called Human Resources, not just resources

----

## These things bothered me for years

I did nothing about it and I was generally depressed and withdrawn from everything.

Until someone saw I had a aptitude for software development and how it relates heavily on human interaction.

They brought me to a software conference and what happened next changed my life.

----

## Learning

A 5 minute conversation with a software engineer I had never met before nudged me of the cliff.

----

## I have value.

I can be valuable and still be humble.

----

## Your users have value.

Spend time with your stakeholders. Take them to lunch. Build a relationship with them.

DEV verses QA? Don't let that be a thing. We are all building a product and we should help and support each other.

----

## That voice in your head... try to make it positive.

Get off your butt and do something. It could be code. It could be that hobby you've been neglecting.

----

## Who are you?

Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

----

Extraversion or Introversion

Sensing or Intuition

Thinking or Feeling

Judging or Perceiving

----

## ISTJ

I flip between extraversion and introversion. 

I like having data and thought behind my decisions

I like to make those decisions quickly.

----

## Understanding the environment

First off, there is no perfect place. Some are better than others.

What is awesome for me you might hate.

----

## Sharing experiences and lessons with others

The best way to learn to to start teaching.

Multiple perspectives enhance your ability to grow and understand the landscape of the situation.

----

## Business owners dont' trust us and we don't trust them

It's both of ours faults and it comes down to communication and execution.

We are a necessary and heavy financial investment.

We want to be invested in to stay relevant. 

Companies want sustainable and stable solutions. This includes the tech and the people. 

----

## Understanding other perspectives
  
I started to be confident in meetings. 

I started to be listened to.

Little by little I was given more responsibility and power to get the right things done.

----

## And it all blew up in my face.

----

## And I should have been fired.

----

## Refactoring the environment

You got to have support from the top down.

----

## Take it slow

To much change will cause your plans to fall apart.

Have the big ideas and execute them in small cycles.

----

## Don't let the business give a damn about your agile processes

This was created by software developers for software developers.

----

## Manifesto for Agile **Software** Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

----

## Manifesto for Agile **Software** Development

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

----

## Manifesto for Agile **Software** Development

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Here's the biggest mistake of my career

I tried to force Agile on an entire enterprise that didn't give a damn.

They didn't get it. They didn't care. They thought nothing was wrong.

----

## Sensing the environment, Learning the signs of toxicity, Understanding people's perspectives

I failed to follow the advice I just gave you.

Don't do what I did.

----

## Moving On

I wasn't going to get what I wanted at my company.

I wasn't going to get what I was worth.

It was never going to happen. 

I owed them nothing more. 

----

## Here's the second biggest mistake of my career

I moved on to another company and I got a 30% increase in my salary.

----

## Two Question interview

They dominated the interview and I was only asked two questions. 

I only asked them two.

----

## I had never been so miserable in my life

Thought about taking a job at a bar.

Then I realized I just wanted to be a bar patron.

Then I ended up as the breadwinner for the household.

I was stuck. I wanted to just quit and take some time off. I couldn't.

----

## Next round of interviews

I spent about 3 or 4 hours research and interviewing the community about potential employers.

I asked a few questions that were very pointed around the idea of everything we just talked about.

Don't move for just money, move for quality of life.

----

## Find the right fit for you

October 2018. Started as a Quality Assurance Engineer.

----

## The right fit might just find you

6 months later, promoted to Product Owner. 

I have achieved my 10 year goal I set for myself back in college and reached it in 8.

----

## Now WTF do I do?

More importantly, WTF are you going to go out and do?

----

You have a story.
